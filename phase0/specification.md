## Fitness Tracker with Social Media

We want to develop an android app that will serve as a fitness tracker with a social media 
component for fitness enthusiasts who want to monitor and share their fitness experience.

##### Introduction

The app is for users who are seeking additional help with enhancing their wellness by allowing
us to track their healthy lifestyle and workout routines. The users will be able to follow 
training regimens and keep a note of their everyday accomplishments. The app will be merged
with social media aspects, where the users will not only be able to track their own progress,
but also follow other users and get new ideas for their own workout regime. Furthermore, the
app will come with numerous types of exercises including (but not limited to) weighted, 
cardio, and calisthenics exercises. The app will also provide the user with useful statistics
such as their average duration of a workout, their linear progression (such as volume, one-rep
max, personal records) so that they can compare their progress with other users. 


##### Usage Breakdown

1. Users of the app will be required to create a profile to begin using the app. 
They will need to provide their full name, a desired username, and their desired password.


2. Once a profile is created, the user will have the ability to create a workout by selecting
a collection of exercises. If the desired exercise is not available, the user will be able 
to create that exercise.


3. The users will also be able to create a routine, which is a collection of workouts.
A routine will allow the user to organize their workouts and group them.


4. Optionally, the user will be able to create a weekly schedule for their workouts.


5. Once all the workouts and routines are set up, the user can start their workout whenever
they want. The workout screen will then be displayed, where the user can track their sets, 
reps, weight or time.

   
6. When the user has finished the workout, they can end the workout which will then 
publish this workout on their profile as a post. Other users will be able to comment and 
like this post.


7. Additionally, the users will have a feed where they will see posts from the users they
decide to follow. They can also like and comment on these posts. To find other users and 
view their profiles, the user can search them by their username. The app will also suggest
other users to them.
